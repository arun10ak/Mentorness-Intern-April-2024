# Plane-crush-analysis-using-power-Bi
This project focuses on conducting a comprehensive analysis of airplane crashes and fatalities
spanning from 1980 to 2023. The dataset contains crucial information such as crash dates, locations,
operators, flight details, aircraft types, and fatality statistics. The goal is to leverage Power BI for
interactive visualizations and in-depth insights to understand patterns, contributing factors, and trends in
aviation incidents. The analysis aims to provide stakeholders with valuable information for enhancing
aviation safety and mitigating risks.

### Dataset Description:

1. Date: Date of the airplane crash.
2. Time: Time of the airplane crash.
3. Location: Location where the airplane crash occurred.
4. Operator: Operator or airline involved in the incident.
5. Flight #: Flight number associated with the incident.
6. Route: Planned route of the flight.
7. AC Type: Aircraft type involved in the crash.
8. Registration: Registration details of the aircraft.
9. cn/ln: Construction or serial number of the aircraft.
10. Aboard: Total number of individuals aboard the aircraft.
11. Aboard Passengers: Number of passengers aboard the aircraft.
12. Aboard Crew: Number of crew members aboard the aircraft.
13. Fatalities: Total fatalities in the incident.
14. Fatalities Passengers: Number of passenger fatalities.
15. Fatalities Crew: Number of crew member fatalities.
16. Ground: Casualties on the ground, if any.
17. Summary: Brief summary or description of the incident.

### Project Objectives:

1. Temporal Analysis:
- Explore temporal trends in airplane crashes over the years.
- Identify patterns in the frequency and severity of incidents.
 
2. Geospatial Analysis:
- Visualize crash locations on a map to identify hotspots.
- Analyse the distribution of incidents across different regions.

3. Operator Performance:
- Evaluate the safety records of different operators and airlines.
- Identify operators with higher incident rates.
4. Aircraft Analysis:
- Analyse the involvement of specific aircraft types in incidents.
- Examine the relationship between aircraft registration and crash occurrences.
5. Fatality Trends:
- Explore trends in passenger and crew fatalities.
- Investigate factors contributing to fatalities.
6. Route Analysis:
- Analyse incident patterns on specific flight routes.
- Identify routes with a higher likelihood of incidents.
  
### Deliverables:
- Interactive Power BI dashboards presenting visualizations of temporal, geospatial, and operational
analyses.
- Reports on operator performance, aircraft involvement, and fatality trends.
- Insights into potential risk factors and recommendations for improving aviation safety.

   ### Temporal Analysis:
 ![DASH]()
Post-2000, there has been a noticeable decline in the number of airplane crashes, indicating an improvement in safety measures.
The most substantial increase in crashes occurred between 1940 and 1950.
Approximately 25% of crashes were attributed to weather conditions, 8.5% to attacks, and the majority, 68%, were due to other causes.

 ### Geospatial Analysis:
 ![image]()
The regions with the highest incidence of airplane crashes are predominantly Russia, China, and Europe. However, the dataset lacks information regarding crashes in the USA.
 ### Operator Performance:

Aeroflot stands out as the operator with the highest number of crashes, totaling 255 incidents, followed by the U.S. Air Force with 139 crashes.
### Aircraft Analysis:
![22]()
Among aircraft types, the Douglas DC-3 has the highest crash frequency, with a total of 18 incidents, followed by the Douglas C-47 with 16 crashes.
### Fatality Analysis:

Overall, there have been 112K fatalities, with 17K crew deaths and 91K passenger deaths. Aeroflot alone accounts for 8858 fatalities.
Route Analysis:
![image]()


The majority of crashes occurred on routes categorized as unknown (777), followed by training routes (93).
Outcome:

The decline in crashes post-2000 suggests significant improvements in safety measures within the aviation industry.
